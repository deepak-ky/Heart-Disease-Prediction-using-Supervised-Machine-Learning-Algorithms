# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Supervised-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

The goal of this research was to examine the performance of different supervised machine learning algorithms for predicting heart disease. which were **“Logistic Regression”
(LR), “Decision Tree” (DT), “Random Forest” (RF), “Support Vector Machine” (SVM), “Gaussian Naïve Bayes”(GNB) and “k-Nearest Neighbor” (kNN)**.Many prior researches on the same topic were analyzed. In this study it was found out that **Random Forest algorithm performed the 
best with 98.53% accuracy and GNB the worst with 74.63% accuracy**. It was mainly due to **one-hot encoding** that was done which helped Random Forest in making better informed decisions. Further work that can be done in this area is 
increasing the accuracy using hyper-parameter tuning and using a larger dataset.
