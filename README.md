# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Supervised-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

The goal of this research was to examine the performance of different supervised machine learning algorithms for predicting heart disease. which were “Logistic Regression”
(LR), “Decision Tree” (DT), “Random Forest” (RF), “Support Vector Machine” (SVM), “Gaussian Naïve Bayes”(GNB) and “k-Nearest Neighbor” (kNN).Many prior researches on the same topic were analyzed. In this study it was found out that random Forest algorithm performed the 
best with 98.53% accuracy and GNB the worst with 74.63% accuracy. It was mainly due to one-hot encoding that was done which helped Random Forest in making better informed decisions. Further work that can be done in this area is 
increasing the accuracy using hyper-parameter tuning and using a larger dataset.
